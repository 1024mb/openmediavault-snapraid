Description: snapraid plugin for OpenMediaVault.
 SnapRAID is a backup program for disk arrays. It stores parity
 information of your data and it's able to recover from up to two
 disk failures.
 .
 SnapRAID is mainly targeted for a home media center, with a lot of
 big files that rarely change.
 .
 Beside the ability to recover from disk failures, other features of
 SnapRAID are:
 * All your data is hashed to ensure data integrity and to avoid
   silent corruption.
 * If the failed disks are too many to allow a recovery, you lose the
   data only on the failed disks. All the data in the other disks is safe.
 * If you accidentally delete some files in a disk, you can recover them.
 * You can start with already filled disks.
 * The disks of the array can have different sizes.
 * You can add disks at any time.
 * It doesn't lock-in your data. You can stop using SnapRAID at any time
   without the need to reformat or move data.
